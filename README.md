# Chess
Creating an exploratory analysis of outcomes for chess games

## Summary  

In this project, we create an exploratory analysis of a dataset on Lichess Chess games. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess).  

We take a look at win rates and how they are affected by openings, Elo rating and if the game is rated or unrated.
